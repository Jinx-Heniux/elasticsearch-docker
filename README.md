This repository is no longer used to generate the official Elasticsearch Docker image from Elastic.

The image is now built from the [Elasticsearch repository](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/tree/master/distribution/docker).

To build the Elasticsearch docker image for versions before 6.6.0, checkout the corresponding release branch in this repository.
